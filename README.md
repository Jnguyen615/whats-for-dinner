# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

I built a functional website to give users idea's on what to make for dinner using all Vietnamese recipes. The problem is users now knowing what to make! This gives them ideas on what to make and from there they can go find out how to make it. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

To get this app running, you have to go to https://github.com/Jnguyen615/whats-for-dinner to see my repository for the project. Then you hit can clone it down to your local, by looking for the SSH key on the green 'code' drop down button. From there copy the SSH key and go to the terminal and type git clone and the SSH key that was provided. To open it use the terminal and type in `open index.html`. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I had 5 and 1/2 days to complete it after classes on the weekdays and on and off during the weekend. It took me over 20 hours as I needed to troubleshoot issues along the way and I still ended up not figuring out one part of it. I am in mod 1 for the second time, and I'm glad to be able to do this again and get an better understanding of it all.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

The learning goals for this project were to be able to build a website using javascript, css and html. It also gave an opportunity to learn about how to deal with user events on a page and how javascript interacts with them. This project gaves students a chance to individualize how they produce an application as well. I worked with google the most, sifting though many documents to find information that was relevant to what I was trying to do. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?) 

The whole project is a win as I chose the intermediate CSS adventure which was extremely challenging and rewarding. Working with responsive screen size and making a spinner loading image were my favorite parts. I love the text fading in, however, my biggest challenge with it is I couldn't figure out how to make it always fade in on click, not just on refresh. I poured hours into troubleshooting it and in the end didn't manage to get it. I do want to figure it out eventually and implement it so it's running how I want it to. I am still working on being better with commits, but I do feel like I was better with branches this time over previous times, as well as with commit messages.
